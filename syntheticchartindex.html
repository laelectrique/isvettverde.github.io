 	<h1>The Toxic Trail of Synthetic Dyes</h1>
	<p>By: Isvett Verde</p>
	
	<p>The majority of natural dyes are vegetable dyes from plant sources. A great source for natural dyes can be found in your own backyard. Roots, nuts and flowers are just a few.</p>

	<p>Synthetic dyes are made through chemical reactions. Every dye has a different chemistry. They’re usually made from petroleum in combination with mineral derived compounds. Synthetic dyes have more vivid colors, cost less to produce in large quantities,and offer a limitless pallette of colors. The first human-made dye – mauveine –  was created by Henry Perkin in 1856.</p>

	<p>Chemicals used during the dye process</p>

	<h2>
		<ul>
		<li><a>Azo dyes, some of which can later release cancer-causing chemicals</a></li>
		<li><a>Nonylphenol Ehtoxylates or NPEs</a></li>
		<li><a>Plastisol (a substance consisting of a mixture of a resin and a plasticizer that can be made into a 	continuous film by application of heat) formulations containing phthalates is used for printing images on textiles</a></li>
		</ul>
	</h2>

	<p>AZO colorants are the most important class of synthetic dyes and pigments, representing 60 – 80% of all organic colorants.They are used widely in substrates such as textile fibers, leather, plastics, papers, hair, mineral oils, waxes, foodstuffs and cosmetics. NPE (nonylphenol ethoxylates) are used in textile production for scouring, conditioning and dye-levelling, mainly for wool. Pthalates are used as ‘plasticisers to make hard plastics more flexible and as adhesive dyes and solvents in other products.</p>

		<blockquote>NPEs were found in a total of 89 articles or 63% of all items tested</blockquote>

	<p>The global textile industry then delivers clothes containing these chemicals to markets around the world. Including, those in the EU where NPEs are effectively banned in clothing manufacture.</p>

	<p>Hazardous chemicals from the washing of new clothes, including hormone-disrupting NPs, end up in rivers, lakes and other public waterways around the world.</p>

	<p>These waste that comes from these chemicals or effluents are released into waterways. NPEs breakdown to form persistent, toxic, hormone-disrupting nonylphenol (NP), which can accumulate and build up in the food chain. Effluents also contain toxic phthalates, carcinogenic chemicals, and other hazardous substances which are detrimental to fish.</p>
